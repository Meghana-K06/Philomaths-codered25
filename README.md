Virtual & Audio Accessibility Platform: 
Overview
This platform is designed to provide an accessible environment for specially-abled students. It includes various features like Image Captioning, Gesture-Controlled Navigation, Speech-to-Text, and Sign Language Recognition. The platform is equipped with speech synthesis for interaction and hand gesture detection for enhanced usability.

Features
Login/Signup Interface:

Allows students to sign up and log in using their Student ID.
Speech prompts guide the user through each step.
Dashboard:

Includes options like Image to Text, Sign Language, Progress Tracker, and more.
Accessible through voice commands, such as "Press 1 for Image to Text."
Image to Text:

Converts images to descriptive text using the BLIP Model.
Uses Gradio to create a user-friendly interface for real-time captioning.
Gesture Control:

Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe and OpenCV:
Simulates a virtual mouse with hand gestures: index finger for movement and thumb for clicking.
Movements are translated to screen coordinates, and clicking is triggered by the distance between the index and thumb fingers.
Accessibility Features:

Voice-based instructions and controls.
User-friendly design to ensure smooth interaction and navigation for students with various abilities.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
Flask: Web framework for backend and routing.
Gradio: For the interactive BLIP Image Captioning interface.
MediaPipe: For detecting hand gestures and processing them.
OpenCV: For image processing and webcam interaction.
pyautogui: For controlling the mouse using hand gestures.
How It Works
Sign Up/Login:

Students can press 1 to log in or 2 to sign up.
The system verifies the Student ID and redirects to the dashboard.
Dashboard Navigation:

The user can navigate through options like Image to Text, Sign Language, etc., by typing a choice or using voice.
A virtual mouse is controlled via the webcam and hand gestures, such as the index finger for cursor movement and thumb for clicks.
Image Captioning:

Upload an image and get a real-time caption generated by the BLIP model.
Gesture Control:

The system uses MediaPipe to detect hand positions (index and thumb fingers).
It maps the hand position to screen coordinates, allowing for mouse movements and clicks through pyautogui.
Instructions
Sign Up/Login Process
Press 1: Login by entering your Student ID.
Press 2: Sign up with your Name and Student ID.
Once logged in, the student is directed to the Dashboard.
Dashboard:
Image to Text: Type 1 to enter the Image-to-Text feature.
Sign Language: Type 2 to explore sign language features.
Voice Interaction: Instructions will be spoken, guiding the user to the next action.
Hand Gesture Control:
Index Finger: Controls the mouse movement.
Thumb: Triggers a click if near the index finger (within a 100-pixel range).
Installation and Requirements
Install Python 3.x
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui gradio flask transformers
Run the Flask app:
Start the server: python main.py
Open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the platform.
Future Enhancements
Smooth cursor movement: Implementing smoother interpolation between positions.
Error Handling: Adding error handling for missing hands or other edge cases.
Improved speech feedback: More interactive voice responses and feedback options.
This platform aims to empower specially-abled students by leveraging accessible technology. We hope it helps provide an inclusive learning environment!
